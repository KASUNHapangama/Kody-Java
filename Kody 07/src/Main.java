        //=======Packages (ep 30)==========

        //You can make classes as another .java file and u shuld do that
        //bc Main.java is just main Class so you are making classes inside of
        //main class but you dont have to.. so,

        //you can create classes as new .java file
        // by write clicking .scr folder > new > java class

        //Packages are Group of Classes
        //just like a Folder
        //You can create package by
        //Write Click src > New > Package

        //Reason..

        //With packages you can have 2 classes in 2 packages
        //with same name

        //You can share the code with others and others can
        //use ur classes in their own package

        //check sky class for more info

        System.out.println(sky.birds);


        //im gonna create new project to
        //next ep (31) bc this is gonna be mess
        //if i made more classes here, Bye :D
